	<h1>Hi there, I'm Lucas Noce</h1>
	<p>I am a statistician born in Buenos Aires, Argentina and since 1999 I work and live in Europe (Italy, Spain and Germany). I am 
		willing to collaborate in projects related to the analysis, visualization and data documentation. I also love 
		teaching and explaining statistics, so you can contact me if you need a professional with a strong quantitative
		background and ability to communicate results and statistical methods in simple terms to a
		wide audience. <a href="/about">More about my skills here</a></p>. You can check a list of data related tasks here.
